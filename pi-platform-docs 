## Idea 1: Documentation

* The repository contains a `README.md` file that provides a brief description of the project and some code snippets.
* The repository also includes a `SECURITY.md` file that outlines the security policy and supported versions.
* The `LICENSE` file contains the GNU Affero General Public License, which governs the use and distribution of the software.
* The `.gitignore` file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
* The `.github/workflows/blank.yml` and `.github/workflows/deno.yml` files define GitHub Actions workflows for the project.

## Idea 2: Project structure

* The repository includes a `pi_sbk.js` file that appears to contain JavaScript code related to the Pi SDK.
* The `README.md` file provides some information about the project and includes a code snippet for signing in a user.
* The `.github/workflows/blank.yml` and `.github/workflows/deno.yml` files define GitHub Actions workflows for the project.
* The `.gitignore` file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
* The `LICENSE` file contains the GNU Affero General Public License, which governs the use and distribution of the software.

## Idea 3: GitHub Actions

* The repository includes two GitHub Actions workflow files: `.github/workflows/blank.yml` and `.github/workflows/deno.yml`.
* The `.github/workflows/blank.yml` file defines a basic workflow that runs on push or pull request events for the "main" branch and includes steps for checking out the repository and running some commands.
* The `.github/workflows/deno.yml` file defines a workflow for setting up Deno, running a linter, and running tests.
* Both workflow files are located in the `.github/workflows` directory.
