# Platform API

The platform API allows you to read and write data to the Pi Servers related with your app deployed on the
Pi App Platform, and your app's users.

## Overview

### Base path:

The latest version of the Platform API is available at `api.minepi.com/v2`.

> **Note about API versioning:**
>
> The platform API is currently in v2.
> As much as possible, we will not make any breaking changes to a version of an API, and only release breaking changes as
> new major versions. However, we might make breaking changes to an existing version without notice, if those are
> necessary (e.g security or privacy fixes).

### Authorization

The Platform API supports two different authorization mechanisms.

#### Access token authorization

Some API calls require that you provide a user's access token to access the resource. They are generally related with
a user's data (e.g: `/me`). Those endpoints can be accessed using the following Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <user access token>
```

Those endpoints can be indifferently accessed from your backend / server app, or from your frontend / client app.

#### Server API Key authorization

For various reasons, some API calls must be made from your backend / server app.
Those endpoints can be accessed using the following Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Key <your Server API Key>
```

> **Warning: Server API keys are for servers only**
>
> Your Server API Key **must** be kept on your server, and must not be sent to clients (do not use it in your
> client javascript code).
> In the future, your server API key might enable sensitive operations on your app itself that your users should
> not be allowed to perform. Letting users access your server API key is a **serious security breach**.


## API Reference

### Payments

Base path: `/payments`.

#### Create a payment:

Do not create payments using the Platform API. Use the client-side Javascript SDK for this purpose.

#### Get a payment:

Get information about a payment.

```
GET /payments/{payment_id}
```

* Authorization method: **Server API Key**
* Response type: [PaymentDTO](#PaymentDTO)

#### Approve a payment:

Server-side approval: mark a payment as approved, enabling the user to submit the transaction to the blockchain.

```
POST /payments/{payment_id}/approve
```

* Authorization method: **Server API Key**
* Response type: [PaymentDTO](#PaymentDTO)

#### Complete a payment:

Server-side completion: mark a payment as completed by proving to the Pi Servers that your app has obtained the
payment's txid, enabling the user to close the payment flow.

```
POST /payments/{payment_id}/complete
```


* Authorization method: **Server API Key**
* Response type: [PaymentDTO](#PaymentDTO)

Example request body:

```
{
  "txid": "7a7ed20d3d72c365b9019baf8dc4c4e3cce4c08114d866e47ae157e3a796e9e7"
}
```

## Resource types

### `PaymentDTO`

```typescript

    "developer_completed": boolean, // Server-Side Completion
    "cancelled": boolean, // Cancelled by the developer or by Pi Network
    "user_cancelled": boolean, // Cancelled by the user
  },
  
  // Blockchain transaction data:
  "transaction": null | { // This is null if no transaction has been made yet
    "txid": string, // The id of the blockchain transaction
