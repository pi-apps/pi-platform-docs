# Platform API

The platform API allows you to read and write data to the Pi Servers related with your app deployed on the
Pi App Platform, and your app's users.

## Overview

### Base path:

The latest version of the Platform API is available at `api.minepi.com/v2`.

> **Note about API versioning:**
>
> The platform API is currently in v2.
> As much as possible, we will not make any breaking changes to a version of an API, and only release breaking changes as
> new major versions. However, we might make breaking changes to an existing version without notice, if those are
> necessary (e.g security or privacy fixes).

### Authorization

The Platform API supports two different authorization mechanisms.

#### Access token authorization

Some API calls require that you provide a user's access token to access the resource. They are generally related with
a user's data (e.g: `/me`). Those endpoints can be accessed using the following Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <user access token>
```

Those endpoints can be indifferently accessed from your backend / server app, or from your frontend / client app.

#### Server API Key authorization

For various reasons, some API calls must be made from your backend / server app.
Those endpoints can be accessed using the following Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Key <your Server API Key>
```

> **Warning: Server API keys are for servers only**
>
> Your Server API Key **must** be kept on your server, and must not be sent to clients (do not use it in your
> client javascript code).
> In the future, your server API key might enable sensitive operations on your app itself that your users should
> not be allowed to perform. Letting users access your server API key is a **serious security breach**.

## API Reference

### Authentication

#### Access a user's resource:

Retrieve the user's information, including user information limited to what the user has consented to share
with your app.

```
GET /me
```

- Authorization method: **Access token**
- Response type: [UserDTO](#UserDTO)

Verify the data obtained with the frontend SDK (a malicious user could tamper with the requests and
send you wrong data) by sending the user’s access token to your backend and using this API endpoint
to verify the token validity and the user’s identity.

Access tokens are long, random strings, and the request will fail (401 HTTP error code) if the token
has been tampered with (a tampered token would
not belong to any real user).

### Payments

There are two different payment types.

1. U2A (User-To-App)
2. A2U (App-To-User)

#### Create a payment (U2A):

If a payment type is U2A, use `createPayment` method of the client-side Javascript SDK to create a payment. You can refer to [Payments](./SDK_reference.md#payments) section for more details.

#### Create a payment (A2U):

```
POST /payments
```

- Authorization method: **Server API Key**
- Response type: [PaymentDTO](#PaymentDTO)

Example request body:

```
{
  "payment": {
    "amount": 1,
    "memo": "From app to user test",
    "metadata": {"test": "test metadata"},
    "uid": "a1111111-aaaa-bbbb-2222-ccccccc3333d"
  }
}
```

#### Get a payment:

Get information about a payment.

```
GET /payments/{payment_id}
```

- Authorization method: **Server API Key**
- Response type: [PaymentDTO](#PaymentDTO)

#### Approve a payment:

Server-side approval: mark a payment as approved, enabling the user to submit the transaction to the blockchain.

```
POST /payments/{payment_id}/approve
```

- Authorization method: **Server API Key**
- Response type: [PaymentDTO](#PaymentDTO)

#### Complete a payment:

Server-side completion: mark a payment as completed by proving to the Pi Servers that your app has obtained the
payment's txid, enabling the user to close the payment flow.

```
POST /payments/{payment_id}/complete
```

- Authorization method: **Server API Key**
- Response type: [PaymentDTO](#PaymentDTO)

Example request body:

```
{
  "txid": "7a7ed20d3d72c365b9019baf8dc4c4e3cce4c08114d866e47ae157e3a796e9e7"
}
```

#### Cancel a payment:

Mark the payment as cancelled.

```
POST /payments/{payment_id}/cancel
```

- Authorization method: **Server API Key**
- Response type: [PaymentDTO](#PaymentDTO)

#### Get incomplete server payments:

Returns the list of server payments (i.e A2U payments) which are in EITHER one of the two states below:

- payment created, but no blockchain transaction was made yet ;
- blockchain transaction submitted, but the payment has not been completed by the developer.

```
GET /payments/incomplete_server_payments
```

- Authorization method: **Server API Key**
- Response type: { "incomplete_server_payments": Array<[PaymentDTO](#PaymentDTO)> }

### Ads

#### Verify a rewarded ad status

Verify status of a rewarded ad by `adId` returned by client Pi SDK method `displayAd('rewarded')`

```
GET /ads_network/status/:adId
```

- Authorization method: **Server API Key**
- Response type: [RewardedAdStatusDTO](#RewardedAdStatusDTO)

### Pi Ruby SDK Integration

#### Initialize the SDK

To initialize the Pi Ruby SDK, you need to provide your Pi API Key and the Private Seed of your app wallet.

```ruby
require 'pinetwork'
# DO NOT expose these values to public
api_key = "YOUR_PI_API_KEY"
wallet_private_seed = "S_YOUR_WALLET_PRIVATE_SEED" # starts with S
pi = PiNetwork.new(api_key: api_key, wallet_private_seed: wallet_private_seed)
```

#### Create an A2U payment

To create an A2U payment, use the `create_payment` method. Make sure to store your payment data in your database.

```ruby
user_uid = "user_uid_of_your_app"
payment_data = {
  "amount": 3.14,
  "memo": "Refund for apple pie",
  "metadata": {"product_id": "apple-pie-1"}, # this is just an example
  "uid": user_uid
}
# It is critical that you store the payment_id in your database
# so that you don't double-pay the same user, by keeping track of the payment.
payment_id = pi.create_payment(payment_data)
```

#### Submit the payment to the Pi Blockchain

To submit the payment to the Pi Blockchain, use the `submit_payment` method. It is strongly recommended that you store the txid along with the payment_id you stored earlier for your reference.

```ruby
txid = pi.submit_payment(payment_id)
```

#### Complete the payment

After checking the transaction with the txid you obtained, you must complete the payment using the `complete_payment` method. Upon completing, the method returns the payment object.

```ruby
payment = pi.complete_payment(payment_id, txid)
```

## Resource types
