# Frontend Javascript SDK

The JS SDK is the frontend SDK, designed to be used in your HTML pages or Single-Page Apps, served in the Pi Browser.

In order to enable the SDK to function correctly, you need to declare your apps on the Developer Portal (open
develop.pi in the Pi Browser to access the Developer Portal).

This SDK is **not** for a server-side NodeJS app.


## Installation

Add the following `script` tags to all pages where you need to call the Pi Apps SDK:
You can view the full details of the issue "Frontend Javascript SDK" on the Pi Platform Docs repository by following this link: Issue #511
```html
<script src="https://sdk.minepi.com/pi-sdk.js"></script>
<script>Pi.init({ version: "2.0" })</script>
```

This will load the Pi Network JS SDK as a global `window.Pi` object.

## Usage

### Authenticate a user

You cannot perform any user-related operations (e.g read the user's info, request a payment from them) until you
have successfully authenticated the user. The first time, they will be presented with a dialog asking for
their consent to share their data with your app.

```javascript
// Authenticate the user, and get permission to request payments from them:
const scopes = ['payments'];

// Read more about this callback in the SDK reference:
function onIncompletePaymentFound(payment) { /* ... */ };

Pi.authenticate(scopes, onIncompletePaymentFound).then(function(auth) {
  console.log(`Hi there! You're ready to make payments!`);
}).catch(function(error) {
  console.error(error);
});
```

### Request a payment (User-To-App)

The `createPayment` method enables you to request a payment from the current user to your app's account.

The user will be prompted with a modal provided by the Pi Wallet, enabling them to sign the
transaction and submit it to the Pi Blockchain.

```javascript

Pi.createPayment({
  // Amount of Ï€ to be paid:
  amount: 3.14,
  // An explanation of the payment - will be shown to the user:
  memo: "...", // e.g: "Digital kitten #1234",
  // An arbitrary developer-provided metadata object - for your own usage:
  metadata: { /* ... */ }, // e.g: { kittenId: 1234 }
}, {
  // Callbacks you need to implement - read more about those in the detailed docs linked below:
  onReadyForServerApproval: function(paymentId) { /* ... */ },
  onReadyForServerCompletion: function(paymentId, txid) { /* ... */ },
  onCancel: function(paymentId) { /* ... */ },
  onError: function(error, payment) { /* ... */ },
## Idea 1: Documentation

* The repository contains a `README.md` file that provides a brief description of the project and some code snippets.
* The repository also includes a `SECURITY.md` file that outlines the security policy and supported versions.
* The `LICENSE` file contains the GNU Affero General Public License, which governs the use and distribution of the software.
* The `.gitignore` file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
* The `.github/workflows/blank.yml` and `.github/workflows/deno.yml` files define GitHub Actions workflows for the project.

## Idea 2: Project structure

* The repository includes a `pi_sbk.js` file that appears to contain JavaScript code related to the Pi SDK.
* The `README.md` file provides some information about the project and includes a code snippet for signing in a user.
* The `.github/workflows/blank.yml` and `.github/workflows/deno.yml` files define GitHub Actions workflows for the project.
* The `.gitignore` file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
* The `LICENSE` file contains the GNU Affero General Public License, which governs the use and distribution of the software.

## Idea 3: GitHub Actions

* The repository includes two GitHub Actions workflow files: `.github/workflows/blank.yml` and `.github/workflows/deno.yml`.
* The `.github/workflows/blank.yml` file defines a basic workflow that runs on push or pull request events for the "main" branch and includes steps for checking out the repository and running some commands.
* The `.github/workflows/deno.yml` file defines a workflow for setting up Deno, running a linter, and running tests.
* Both workflow files are located in the `.github/workflows` directory.

### Request a payment (App-To-User)

If you want to send Pi from your app to a user, you need to use one of Pi Network's backend SDKs, depending
on the language your backend is written in. Refer to the [Advanced payments guide](./payments_advanced.md)
for more information.


In order to make sure that all involved parties (your app, your server, the Pi servers, and the Pi Blockchain) are in sync,
the payment needs to go through a **Server-Side Approval** flow (for User-to-App payment) and/or a **Server-Side Completion**
flow (for all types of payments).

Please refer to:
* [the full Payments documentation](./payments.md) to learn about the complete payment flow
* [the Advanced Payments documentation](./payments_advanced.md) to learn about App-to-User payment flow
* [the Platform API documentation](./platform_API.md) to learn how to confirm the payment and acknowledge it from your
  server
* [the client SDK documentation](./SDK_reference.md) to learn about Pi Apps SDK and provided methods in detail
* [the Demo App](https://github.com/pi-apps/demo) to view an example of how you can implement the various required flows in your app's code
