# Payments Advanced

While the Pi Frontend Javascript SDK supports creating a U2A (User-To-App) payment, your app might need an ability to
make an A2U (App-To-User) payment. In this documentation, we are going to show you how you can make an A2U payment.

Please note that the A2U payments feature is currently available only on the Testnet.

## Pi Backend SDKs

Here's a list of Pi Backend SDKs for each language (or runtime) you can use for the A2U payment flow.
| Language | Link | Status |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Ruby | [pi-ruby](https://github.com/pi-apps/pi-ruby) | Officially supported by the Pi Core Team |
| Node.js | [pi-nodejs](https://github.com/pi-apps/pi-nodejs) | **Coming soon!** - Officially supported by the Pi Core Team |
| Python | TBD | Community-maintained |
| PHP | TBD | Community-maintained |

Community maintainers for other programming languages are more than welcome, please submit a PR in the [PiOS repository](https://github.com/pi-apps/PiOS) if youare interested to maintain a Pi SDK.


## Supported features

This section is a list of features supported by each backend SDK which enables integrating Pi into an app.
Refer to the specific documentation of the library you're using in your project (see table in the previous section)
for specifics on how to use each feature.

### App-to-user payments

The current design of A2U payments involves both interacting with the Pi Blockchain and the Pi backend. The Pi blockchain is obviously 
the only source of truth for exchanging Pi. The Pi backend is used to improve the end-user experience (e.g. provide users understandable memos 
on their wallet, and link backs to your app, while preserving user and developer privacy by not making this information public on the chain) 
and to assist developers in avoiding to make payment mistakes (e.g. double payments due to server faults)

Benefits:

- **Better user privacy:** This API enables safely accessing a user's wallet address as long as they have consented to
sharing it with your app, and it encourages developers to only access the user's wallet when they have an actual
intent to send them some Ï€, enabling better privacy and user safety.

- **User wallet accuracy:** The API returns the current user wallet if wallet change was necessary, to avoid the app sending Pi to a deprecated,
inaccessible wallet address for the user. 

- **Better experience for users AND app developers:** Once a transaction has happened the blockchain, it can't be reversed.
Letting the Pi backend servers know about your payment before making a transaction, making the transaction and then informing the backend server one 
more time enables recovering the associated metadata and blockchain transaction if a technical issue prevented it from being recorded in your database. 
This way the Pi backend, as a thrid party can help you avoid double payments or other bugs that might accidentally deplete your app wallets by accident.
Of course, there are a lot of things that can go wrong and as the developers of your apps you are the only party responsible for managing your app's 
wallets and assets. The APIs here are provided for as-is and with no guarantees.  

- **Better integration with the Pi ecosystem:** Using the A2U API enables the payment to be shown in the user's wallet as
coming from your app, instead of looking like a random transaction from an unknown address. This can allow beautiful usr experiences in the future such
as direct links backs to your app from the users' wallets or thumbnail icons displaying the goods the users purchased or returned durectly in their wallets. 

## Pi Ruby SDK Integration

### Install

1. Add the following line to your Gemfile:
```ruby
gem 'pinetwork'
```
2. Install the gem
```sh
$ bundle install
```

### Example

1. Initialize the SDK
```ruby
require 'pinetwork'
# DO NOT expose these values to public
api_key = "YOUR_PI_API_KEY"
wallet_private_seed = "S_YOUR_WALLET_PRIVATE_SEED" # starts with S
pi = PiNetwork.new(api_key: api_key, wallet_private_seed: wallet_private_seed)
```

2. Create an A2U payment
Make sure to store your payment data in your database. Here's an example of how you could keep track of the data. Consider this a database table example.
```ruby
uid	product_id	amount	memo	payment_id	txid
user_uid	apple-pie-1	3.14	Refund for apple pie	NULL	NULL
user_uid = "user_uid_of_your_app"
payment_data = {
  "amount": 3.14,
  "memo": "Refund for apple pie",
  "metadata": {"product_id": "apple-pie-1"}, # this is just an example
  "uid": user_uid
}
# It is critical that you store the payment_id in your database
# so that you don't double-pay the same user, by keeping track of the payment.
payment_id = pi.create_payment(payment_data)
```

3. Store the payment_id in your database
After creating the payment, you'll get payment_id, which you should be storing in your database.
```ruby
uid	product_id	amount	memo	payment_id	txid
user_uid	apple-pie-1	3.14	Refund for apple pie	payment_id	NULL
```

4. Submit the payment to the Pi Blockchain
```ruby
# It is strongly recommended that you store the txid along with the payment_id you stored earlier for your reference.
txid = pi.submit_payment(payment_id)
```

5. Store the txid in your database
Similarly as you did in step 3, keep the txid along with other data.
```ruby
uid	product_id	amount	memo	payment_id	txid
user_uid	apple-pie-1	3.14	Refund for apple pie	payment_id	txid
```

6. Complete the payment
```ruby
payment = pi.complete_payment(payment_id, txid)
```

### Overall flow for A2U (App-to-User) payment

To create an A2U payment using the Pi Ruby SDK, here's an overall flow you need to follow:

1. Initialize the SDK
You'll be initializing the SDK with the Pi API Key of your app and the Private Seed of your app wallet.

2. Create an A2U payment
You can create an A2U payment using create_payment method. The method returns a payment identifier (payment id).

3. Store the payment id in your database
It is critical that you store the payment id, returned by create_payment method, in your database so that you don't double-pay the same user, by keeping track of the payment.

4. Submit the payment to the Pi Blockchain
You can submit the payment to the Pi Blockchain using submit_payment method. This method builds a payment transaction and submits it to the Pi Blockchain for you. Once submitted, the method returns a transaction identifier (txid).

5. Store the txid in your database
It is strongly recommended that you store the txid along with the payment id you stored earlier for your reference.

6. Complete the payment
After checking the transaciton with the txid you obtained, you must complete the payment, which you can do with complete_payment method. Upon completing, the method returns the payment object. Check the status field to make sure everything looks correct.

### SDK Reference

This section shows you a list of available methods.

#### create_payment

This method creates an A2U payment.

- Required parameter: payment_data
You need to provide 4 different data and pass them as a single object to this method.
```ruby
payment_data = {
  "amount": number, # the amount of Pi you're paying to your user
  "memo": string, # a short memo that describes what the payment is about
  "metadata": object, # an arbitrary object that you can attach to this payment. This is for your own use. You should use this object as a way to link this payment with your internal business logic.
  "uid": string # a user uid of your app. You should have access to this value if a user has authenticated on your app.
}
```
- Return value: a payment identifier (payment_id)

#### submit_payment

This method creates a payment transaction and submits it to the Pi Blockchain.

- Required parameter: payment_id
- Return value: a tranaction identifier (txid)

#### complete_payment

This method completes the payment in the Pi server.

- Required parameter: payment_id, txid
- Return value: a payment object

The method returns a payment object with the following fields:
```ruby
payment = {
  # Payment data:
  "identifier": string, # payment identifier
  "user_uid": string, # user's app-specific ID
  "amount": number, # payment amount
  "memo": string, # a string provided by the developer, shown to the user
  "metadata": object, # an object provided by the developer for their own usage
  "from_address": string, # sender address of the blockchain transaction
  "to_address": string, # recipient address of the blockchain transaction
  "direction": string, # direction of the payment ("user_to_app" | "app_to_user")
  "created_at": string, # payment's creation timestamp
  "network": string, # a network of the payment ("Pi Network" | "Pi Testnet")
  # Status flags representing the current state of this payment
  "status": {
    "developer_approved": boolean, # Server-Side Approval (automatically approved for A2U payment)
    "transaction_verified": boolean, # blockchain transaction verified
    "developer_completed": boolean, # Server-Side Completion (handled by the create_payment! method)
    "cancelled": boolean, # cancelled by the developer or by Pi Network
    "user_cancelled": boolean, # cancelled by the user
  },
  # Blockchain transaction data:
  "transaction": nil | { # This is nil if no transaction has been made yet
    "txid": string, # id of the blockchain transaction
    "verified": boolean, # true if the transaction matches the payment, false otherwise
    "_link": string, # a link to the operation on the Pi Blockchain API
  }
}
```

#### get_payment

This method returns a payment object if it exists.

- Required parameter: payment_id
- Return value: a payment object

#### cancel_payment

This method cancels the payment in the Pi server.

- Required parameter: payment_id
- Return value: a payment object

#### get_incomplete_server_payments

- Required parameter: none
- Return value: an array which contains 0 or 1 payment object

This method returns the latest incomplete payment which your app has created, if present. Use this method to troubleshoot the following error: "You need to complete the ongoing payment first to create a new one."

If a payment is returned by this method, you must follow one of the following 3 options:

1. cancel the payment, if it is not linked with a blockchain transaction and you don't want to submit the transaction anymore
2. submit the transaction and complete the payment
3. if a blockchain transaction has been made, complete the payment

If you do not know what this payment maps to in your business logic, you may use its metadata property to retrieve which business logic item it relates to. Remember that metadata is a required argument when creating a payment, and should be used as a way to link this payment to an item of your business logic.

### Troubleshooting

#### Error when creating a payment: "You need to complete the ongoing payment first to create a new one."

See documentation for the get_incomplete_server_payments above.
